Even old men (who are no longer masters of their own affairs or interested in the conjugal life) often become monks to end their lives preparing for death. Approximately 10-20% of the population is consecrated to the church service, particularly the male population. Monastic rules amongst the Amhara are so severe that no female animals are allowed inside the monk area. This is the extent to which the separation of the sexes is enforced. Both bride and groom bring dowries into the marriage, including animals such as cows, sheep, and mules. There are mentions where they also bring male and female slaves and servants. Marriage is mostly monogamous but the institution of concubinage (demoz) seems to have some prevalence amongst the Amhara, most likely as a remnant of pre-Christian polygamy."

Taking this into account, Aztecs priests do take vows of celibacy and have been likened to Catholic priests by ethnographers. Polygyny is common amongst the elite, monogamy amongst commoners. Using eHRAF alone, I could find any significant transactions of wealth. The mother of the bride provides the bridegroom with a cape and breech clout and the mother of the groom provides the bride with a skirt and a shift during the wedding ceremony. There is an exchange of gifts, but it does not seem to resemble bridewealth or dowry. Using external sources, including D-PLACE, it seems there was a form of bridewealth practised. Quale (1988: pg. 97) contrasts the indigenous Aztec practices of bridewealth with the European/Spanish dowry practices introduced to Mexico via colonization. For this reason, I will characterize them as a bridewealth practising society."

Kings appointed their daughers as high priestesses, indicating that this was not a practice that arose out of a need to alleviate poverty. They typically receive a dowry from their father (they inherit like sons from their fathers) and are supported by their fathers and brothers throughout their time in the convent. If they hadn't a received a dowry by the time of their parents' death, they receive a share of the movables of the paternal house. These priestesses sometimes marry but are forbidden to bear children. For this reason, their sisters sometimes accompany them to these marriages as serve as surrogates. Other times, they provide their husbands with a concubine to bear them children. Their children do not inherit their wealth, it goes back to their father's lineage. Monogamy was the norm but polygyny was practised such as in the aforementioned examples. Bridewealth, dower, and dowry were common practices during marriage. However, dowry became more sizeable overtime. It is not known whether this correponded sex ratio changes in an urbanizing society or status anxiety (where parents were concerned about their daughers marrying downwards in the social and economic sphere, i.e., where dowry is matched with the status of the groom as is the case in India and China. All of these societies were complex economically and socially by the time dowry was used). Additonally, it is uknown whether this corresponded with an increase in the number of priestesses."

A subsect of Badaga are Lingayat Badaga. Additionally, dairy-priests are  celibates. There is a history of polyandry (until the 19th century) among the Badaga but they mainly practice monogamy and sometimes polygny. They practice bridewealth but dowry began to spread amongst the Badaga in more recent years, but not as a traditional practice. Given that celibacy is not a trait common to Badaga sects, but comes from Lingayat association, and the dearth of information on dairy-priests, I will include them in the celibacy map but exclude them from the analysis. I am unsure whether the marriage patterns have any impact on the emergence of celibacy in the nearby state of Mysore and amongst the Lingayats. They seem to have a 1:1 sex ratio and do not practice infanticide."

There is indication that nuns are much less respected than monks. In one account, the ethnographer wrote that a member of the monastery joked that if there were more intersex monks, they could ""reestablish the bhikkuni order"". This implies that there isn't an existing one and that presence of nuns is sporadic. This may explain their lack of prestige. In contrast, the most prestigious position in society is that of the monk's. In another account, the thila-shin (i.e., nun) order seems to have a presence in Burmese society, especially in the city of Sagaing. One ethnographer wrote that the institutions for nuns waxed and waned. The predominant transaction at marriage is that of the dower (i.e., land given to the wife in case her husband passes away or the couple divorces). There is also dowry (i.e., wealth transferred from the bride's parents to the couple) in villages but it plays a more important role in cities amongst the elites. Burmese hill tribes (the Chin, Kachin, and Shan) mainly practice bridewealth or dowry but they are not tribes of interest in this analysis. Spiro (1977: pg. 196) asks why dower plays such an important role in a society where monks are in abundance and women are not in short supply: men are clearly more valuable in an agriculutural economy. According to villagers, the dower plays an important role in guaranteeing the woman a source of financial stability should her husband be a poor provider or divorce her with haste. It also serves to disintencivize her husband from taking another wife ( implying the existence of polygyny in society). Given the husband resides with the bride's parents temporarily (temporary uxorilocal arragement) and provides them with unpaid agricultural work, the voluntary dowry exists as a form of compensation. With respect to inheritance patterns, both daughters and sons receive a share of parental estate upon their parents' death. Therefore, Burmese husbands acquire a pre-mortem share of their inheritance in marriage (i.e., the dower). That he is given a larger portion than his sister is compensated for by the custom of bequething the house to the daughter (Spiro, 1977: pg. 201). However, why dower is preferred instead of dowry is another matter. In the case of dowry, there is an even stronger expectation that the wife retains the property in case of hasty divorce as the wife brings the property into the marriage. Therefore, the dower is a sufficient but not necessary condition under these circumstances. A higher dower also confers status and prestige to the family of the bride as it indicates that themselves and their daughter are of high value. Therefore, it can said that the dower obtains in Burma, as opposed to bridewealth, for two reasons: (1) bridewealth would not satisfy the economic requirements of the conjugal couple and ensure the economic stability of the wife (as it is retained by her parents) and (2) rights of productivity and reproductivity are not transferred from the bride's family to the groom's family (the usual grounds for bridewealth as bride-recievers offer this payment to the bride-givers in exchange for exclusive rights to her priductivity and reproductivity). The presence of dowry in urban Burma can be attributed to the post-colonial British influence on wealth and status. The two variables essentially came apart and so some families had high wealth and low status whereas other families had vice versa. In order for a man of moderate wealth but high status to marry a woman of high wealth and low status, a dowry payment was arranged (i.e., prestige enhancement). In the 1950s, the state began sponsoring female monastic institutions. It may be the case that increased demand of dowry in urban cities led to the ""mass lay meditation movement"" that allowed women to enter nunneries. Given that there is increased rate of dowry in urban cities and nunneries can be predominantly found in urban cities such as Rangoon and Sagaing, these two factors may be related. However, such a detailed analysis of within-society differences is not possible at this stage. ""The nuns (none of whom are in village monasteries) come, usually on ubonei, from Sagaing to beg for food."" (Nash, 1965: pg. 138) The city of Sagaing is still populated today with these house monasteries as well as other more substantial nuns' institutions (Burmese: thila-shin kyaung[s] ) that operate very much like hpongyi kyaung[s], monks' monasteries (Kawanami 2000). (Nash, 1965: pg. 45) The primary document on nunneries and nuns was conducted in Rangoon. In Bengal, increased dowry is associated with both increased rates of polygyny and infanticide: ""What might be termed the hypertrophy of complex hypergamy is found among the Kulin Brahmans of Bengal, among whom (unlike the case in urban Burma) this practice became uniform and all but mandatory. That is, the males refused to take a bride in the absence of an exorbitant dower, and poor girls were practically deprived of a spouse because, on the one hand, it became shameful to enter into a non-hypergamous marriage and, on the other, their fathers could not raise a sufficiently large dowry to attract a higher status groom. In some cases, this led to the practice of female infanticide among poor families.  Moreover, the desire of the brides's family to marry their daughter to a husband of the highest possible status resulted in a dramatic increase in polygyny, with the additional consequence that some highly prestigious men acquired as many as fifty and even more wives (Risley, 1915: 165–171, 431–440)."" (Spiro, 1977: pg. 206) As polygyny is more common in villages than in cities in Burma, this may be because sibling sisters have other means of relieving competition amongst them (i.e., nunneries)."

However, there are women known as don chi or daun chi who live an ascetic life comparable to the lives of monks. Their numbers are not significant (e.g., 3-6 in one monastery) and they are always old maids or aged widows. They must pay for their own food, unlike the temple boys. There is a description of the vows a monk takes during ordination (Ebihara, 1971: pg. 398). Buddhist monasteries were affected by the prevalence of modern educational institutions, but at a critical point in the late 50s, they trend reversed. Taoist monasteries are briefly mentioned and there is explicit mention that Taoist nuns do not exist. The most prevalent marriage transaction is bridewealth. Bridewealth serves two purposes in this context: first, it a transfer of rights over the woman, her labour, and her sexuality by providing a payment to the parents of the bride who fed her and cared for her. Second, part of the bridewealth is sometimes retained by the couple in the form of jewelery, house, or payment for the wedding. Bride-service used to be a common practice but it declined around the mid 20th century, as women married men with non-agricultural jobs that did not permit them the time required for bride-service (uxorilocality fulfilled a similar purpose to bride-service in that provided the girl's parents with a chance to observe the young man and confirm that he will be a good husband to their daughter). Polygyny is legally permissible in Cambodia at the time the ethnographies were conducted, but was limited to the wealthy. It was rarely practised and was looked down upon. About 90% of Cambodians live in 1/3rd of the land. 80% of the population are agriculturalists. From the 1960s onwards, several major changes occured in Cambodia: civil war, US bombings, the rule of the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) regime and socialist policies in the 1980s'."

The author draws a link between second youngest siblinghood and monasticism and suggests that the aforementioned changes compromise the role monasticism plays in alleviating conflict between siblings and between siblings and parents (the affectionate indulgence is lavished upon the youngest child until about the age of weaning, i.e., 2-3 years, is compared with the neglect experienced by the second youngest sibling by the hands of the mother; Piker, 1975: pg. 321) . Whilst both sexes experience this conflict, young girls are typically initiated into roles assisting their mothers, whereas boys have no positive or structured alternative to the second-youngest-siblinghood. There is an interesting reference in Anderson (1973: pg. 383) about Buddhist priests who go to marry having better prospects given their status in society (important to note that there are no repercussions for leaving monkhood, Sumālī Bamrungsuk, 1995: pg. 88). Where men gain status in monasteries, women gain it through acquiring wealth to keep a male relative in the monastery (Prīchā Khuwinphan, 1980: pg. 112). In Central Thailand, the prevalent transaction at marriage is that of bridewealth. It serves a similar function to the Burmese dower. Villages in Central Thailand have permanent uxorilocal residence patterns. The couple sets up permanent residence in the bride's parents house, and then moves to their compound. They also acquire agricultural necessities from them. Hence, bridewealth (paid in cash) purchases the right of residence in the bride's parents house and use-rights in their means of production. Moreover, since daughters alone share in the inheritance fo the estate, the conjugal couple are therefore ensured ultimate ownership of their share of the estate of the bride's parents. In summary, bridewealth gauarantees the husband rights of use and subequently rights of ownership of his bride's parents land. This then is passed on to his descendants. As such, both Thai bridewealth and Burmese dower serve a similar function insofar as they provide them both with their domestic and agricultural requirements. This is achieved directly in Burma as property is part of the dower and indirectly in Central Thailanad as property is passed on to the husband or conjugal couple through inheritance in exchange for bridewealth. The choice of one rather than the other is governed by different residence and inheritance patterns in both societies. Polygyny was a common practice in the past amongst the elite but was no longer practised by the 1920s. There are a few cases here amongst wealthy men but nothing considerable. However, it remained present in a limited form in rural areas."

""No one in the Andean ayllu could be denied marriage because of the inability to acquire a bride price. These goods—firewood and straw, or coca and dried meat—could be got by all; moreover, mechanisms existed to ensure that they could be easily obtained (Murúa 1946:240). In contrast to African lineage societies, no class of elders controlled the material means through which youth could be manipulated in an exchange process whereby women were traded for objects of material value.

Women could have sambandhams with different men sequentially. ""State laws did not recognize the husband/father as the guardian of the wife and children, nor insisted on his duties of maintenance, nor conceded the claim of the wife and children in his self-acquisitions"". This system involves elements of both polygyny and polyandry. There are different castes in Kerala with different practices: the Nayar practised polygyny and polyandry until law reforms disincentivized these practices. They mainly practised dowry as a result of the influence of Christianity and monogamy, especially where educated sons could demand a large dowry. The Izhavas also practised polyandry and polygyny, mainly as remnants of old customs and isolated cases. By the late 20th century, the Izhava caste distanced themselves from the practice of polyandry and their old, ""shameful and backward"" customs. Christians were monogamous and practised dowry. The Brahmins had polygyny and dowry (see below note on Bengali Brahmins). Finally, there was no information on Buddhists in Kerala practised. I would say with confidence that the milleau was one of polyandry and polygyny up until the mid to late 20th century. Despite the law, social norms dictated whether these practices prevailed. As to the question of celibacy: it looks nothing like it does in Buddhism. The practice of celibacy is more or less up to the individual and there are cases were both men and women practised it. It's just not very common, at least compared with Buddhism. ""What might be termed the hypertrophy of complex hypergamy is found among the Kulin Brahmans of Bengal, among whom (unlike the case in urban Burma) this practice became uniform and all but mandatory. That is, the males refused to take a bride in the absence of an exorbitant dower, and poor girls were practically deprived of a spouse because, on the one hand, it became shameful to enter into a non-hypergamous marriage and, on the other, their fathers could not raise a sufficiently large dowry to attract a higher status groom. In some cases, this led to the practice of female infanticide among poor families. Moreover, the desire of the brides's family to marry their daughter to a husband of the highest possible status resulted in a dramatic increase in polygyny, with the additional consequence that some highly prestigious men acquired as many as fifty and even more wives (Risley, 1915: 165–171, 431–440)."" (Spiro, 1977: pg. 206). High dowries correlated with female infanticide for poor famlies and higher rates of polygyny. Explains why we found no celibacy amongst the Bengal when the conditions for it were present! Same for Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. However, interestingly, there is no female infanticide in Kerala: ""Birth control was not practised since it was contrary to Hindu religious convictions. Abortions were rare, and it could be seen that the population was increasing steadily and unchecked. There was no female infanticide, and both my informant and my interpreter seemed surprised that I should ask if there were. Women were highly valued in Kerala, they said, and there was no reason not to want them."" (Peter, 1963: pg. 225) Perhaps this is a consequence of Kerala being uniquely matrilineal?"

There is tension between them. Clark (1932) mentioned that there more nunneries than monasteries in the Province of Chung-Chong (three times as many nuns as priests). Seems like no evidence of bridewealth: women's parents give her a large dowry and men's parents give her some gifts. This is consistent across all mentions of marriage in the documents, and across time periods. As for marital composition, there is no evidence of polyandry and it seems like monogamy is the prevailing practice. However, there is an institutionalized presence of concubinage where the wife/mothers elects a concubine for her husband/son, who lives with them in their home."

Polygyny seems to have been introduced by the Chinese but seems to be practised by the Manchu as second wives and concubines have a dedicated title and role within the family. There is only mention of infanticide and it is worth exploring, however D-PLACE indicates it is not biased towards either sex. There is an interesting note on the rate of unmarriagable women in Manchuria due to Manchu men taking Han Chinese women as wives/second wives (see highlighted text on details).

It's important to note that there were many mentions of married lamas, and this could be due to the fact that 40% of the male Mongolian popoulation belonged to the Buddhist church. There seems to be homogeneity between ethnic tribes in Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, Siberia, and Outer Mongolia with respect to the uncommon but still sanctioned practice of polygyny. The same applies to the practice of bridewealth, although details of what is transmitted depends on the tribe. As in most societies, dowry is passed down to the bride by her parents. This belongs to her and sometimes happens a few years after marriage."

There seems to be instances of polygyny, however only where the first wife fails to provide a child for her husband. Additionally, there does not seem to be any substantial transfer of wealth during marriage. There are examples where women were given cattle and her clothes as trousseau, some examples of token bride wealth, and others of gift exchange (primarily food). None of these exchanges seem to be meaningful or necessary for the marriage to take place. One ethnographer wrote that Montengrins were subject to harsh conditions during the 18th and 19th centuries: their population size was larger than could be accomodated by their food production. The following factors were mentioned: (1) available land was heavily exploited, (2) high birth rate, and (3) Ottoman Empire prevented land expansion. The circumstances typically lead to starvation or diseases accompanying malnutrition, however this was not common amongst the tribal areas of Montenegro. The introduction of the potato from Russia helped ease the overpopulation problem, but the most significant impact came from raiding other people's food. In the late 19th century, the prohibition of raiding led to the emigration of tens of thousands of hungry Montenegrins to the Balkans and North/South America. As for limiting fertility, infanticide was not part of the customs. Raiding, feuding, and warfare had effects on population growth, especially by reducing the number of men (more specifically, men eligible for marriage). ""The feuding pattern also was developed to such a point that a considerable and much-steadier reduction of population resulted; but with long-term feuding, the population reduction was solely among males."" (Boehm, 1984: pg. 176). ""Once the population had fallen below this carrying capacity, then warfare would become less frequent and feuding would decrease as well, insofar as the causes were economic. (Boehm, 1984: pg. 179)."" Despite this, it seems there was a strong male bias at birth. It could be that either biological or cultural mechanisms adjusted the male birth ratio upwards due to feuding and warfare.  There is a clear bias for sons than daughters amongst the Montenegrins (Boehm, 1983). Taken together, it is likely that the prevalence of monks is an outcome of this problem. Why this was not accompanied by other proxies of male-male competition (e.g., bridewealth) is a mystery to me!"

The lack of celibacy can be attributed to the spread of Shin Buddhism whose founder was not celibate as well as the policy of Shinbutsu Bunri in the 19th century which separated Shinto and Buddhism. The policy led to the widespread destruction of Buddhist temples and the defrocking of Buddhist monks. Despite this, Buddhist nuns remain celibate, however there are much fewer nuns than there are priests in Japan. The data extracted come from ethnographies on farming villages in Okayama in the 1950s and the Bizen Province from 500 - 1700.

The references within these documents, however, are to ""50-60 years ago"" where celibacy was common amongst these priestesses (known as the nuru). At the time the ethnographies were conducted, this was no longer true. There are many mentions of married priestesses. There is also mention that this title is passed down through the female line but I am not sure how to reconcile that with the expectation of celibacy in past times. There is some hinting towards them being of commoner origin and less needed amongst the upper classes. The commoners formerly practised bride wealth and had bride service in lieu of that. Taking second wives is not unheard of, but it doesn't seem to be a systematic practice, at least not in the 1800s. There is reference to an increase in polygyny in the 20th century due to sex ratio problems. (Could be considered a case of limited polygyny)"

It seems that the majority of monks are Greek, Cypriot, or Italian. However, given Christianity's roots in Palestine, it is unlikely that this excludes indigenous Palestinians. Further, the occupation of Israel has had an impact on Palestinian's ability to join monasteries. The prevailing transfer of wealth during marriage, in Christian villages in West Bank and other regions in Israel, is that of bridewealth. Sometimes some or all of that money is dedicated to preparing the house for the conjugal couple. Either way, the transaction at marriage is mainly from the bridegroom's side. Sometimes this is supplemented by some support from the bride's father. Whilst Palestinian Muslims are polygynous, Christians are monogamous. There is one exception, observed by Grant (1921: pg. 63), where a Christian man married another woman as his first wife could not bear children."

Here is an overview: In the 16th century, monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII via the Dissolution of Monasteries. Monks and nuns were driven underground as a result, and naturally their numbers declined rapidly. The mentions from the ethnographies referring to monasteries were those of early Celtic Christianity in Ireland, where monasteries served as substitute to cities as capitals. This period typically refers to 400  - 1100 AD. The later ethnographies, written in the 20th century, mentioned nuns. In this period, dowry was prevalent in the form of groomwealth (with the exception of Tory Island). Brideprice was only given where a man married into a family and did not inherit land from their father. Monogamy was also the prevailing norm for this period. There is no evidence for infanticide."

It seems that in Central Serbia, specifically in Ovčar-Kablar Gorge, there is a collection of monasteries. This region is therefore sometimes dubbed ""Serbian Mount Athos"". There is some mention of nunneries but the focus is largely on monks and monasteries. Some mention that barren women in this society are given to priests and monks to help them with their tasks in monasteries. They are also sometimes inseminated by clergymen (i.e. priests) and this practice is considered a public service even if Orthodox Christianity prohibits this behaviour. There is also some mention that old men have more than one wife. However, I do not think this constitutes evidence of polygyny. Bridewealth was traditionally common but by the late 1930s bridewealth was practised by less than 25% of the villages in Serbia. (See highlighted text) This has been attributed to, not the surplus of women, the ""exceedingly great economic changes, in the transition from cattle-raising to agriculture, and the rapid penetration of money economy under favorable circumstances"". The main period from which our data emerge marks the transition between bridewealth to dowry/groomwealth. There is some evidence for infanticide when a mother does not have the resources to support the infant (it sometimes happens indirectly through neglect) but it is not gender specific."

Given that there are no nuns amongst the Sinhalese, I am not concerned about any regional difference that give rise to the emergence of nuns. It's sufficient to know what marriage transaction is most common amongst the Sinhalese and what marital composition is most prevalent. Seems like dowry from the bride's parents is most common here. Unmarried women inherit, whereas married women do not inherit and receive a dowry from their parents (deega marriages, i.e., hypergamous marriages). However, married women who receive men into their parental homes (as opposed to leave to the groom's home) do inherit. This occurs when the men they marry are poor (binna marriages). These men often provide bride-service as well to the family. In the case where men are wealthy but have poor status, they offer bridewealth (e.g., paying off the father in law's debt). Polyandry can be found amongst the Sinhalese and this can be explained by two reasons: (1) reducing hostility between sibling brothers and (2) allowing siblings to combine land resources where neither husband has sufficient resources to support a family independently (Spiro, 1977: pg. 256)"

Interesting that regions where the Brahman caste reside, where monasteries and pagodas are built, have the highest rates of dowry: ""The causes of indebtedness are many and they cannot be easily found out from registered bonds, because the most false reasons are given there. Brahmans are of all castes the most indebted, the cause being their marriage customs."" (Slater, 1918: pg. 69). It's also interesting to note that there is mention of unmarried women, polygyny, and sambandhams: ""Only the eldest male member of a Nambudri family can marry in his own caste. All the other sons keep Nayar women as mistresses. The eldest member can marry more than one wife, but many women of necessity have to remain unmarried."" (pg. 160) The statement about women ""of necessity"" remaining unmarried might refer to the Nambudri women who are not chosen as wives for the eldest son. If only the eldest son marries within the caste, it may leave many Nambudri women without the opportunity to marry within their own caste. This could lead to them remaining unmarried or marrying into other castes. The puzzle here is why we don't see droves of women joining monasteries/nunneries? We have all the elements: the institution of monasticism, parental control, massive dowries, polygyny, sambandham, and caste endogamy. Whilst practise of female infanticide came to public attention in the 1980s, it's possible that it predates the late 20th century. This could solve the above puzzle."

In circumstances where the family adopts a ""male bride"", it seems that the transfer of wealth goes to the groom's side of the family. However, this was not common in my readings. In most occasions, there is a dowry given to the bride by both sides of the family. The bride's side of the family sometimes delay their dowry to the daughter, sometimes by 7 to 8 years, to ensure first that she is in a happy marriage. Marriage type: It seems to me that polyandry is prevalent in Western Tibet, Central Tibet, and in Kham (i.e., Eastern TIbet). Polygyny is also common to these areas.

By the second half of the century, polygyny turned into monogamy and Tongan women joined convents. For this reason, I chose monogamy as the prevailing practice as this was the environment Tongan nuns were living in. When polygyny was common, it was mainly amongst the chiefs. It still exists today in the form of successive polygamy, where women enter several marriages in their lifetime. Ethnographers have noted that this results in violence between men and high rates of murder, as women leave marriages with chiefs and marry commoners (Lātūkefu, 1974: pg. 124) There is an exchange of gifts between both sides of the families (i.e., koloa). These are usually hand-made items such as bark cloths, covers, curtains and mats. However, the extent to which this practice is prevalent amongst Catholic communities is unclear. It seems like missionaries inadvertedly encouraged abortion by condemning of illegitmate children and encouraging sexual availability after birth (which was uncommon amongst Tongans to prevent pregnancy and premature weaning). Infanticide was historically rare, except where people strangled a child as a sacrifice to the gods when a chief was ill."
